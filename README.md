# Website-Blocker
A simple, personalised website blocker.

### Need
- While working/studying, we might get distracted because of various websites (e.g. Netflix, Facebook, YouTube) and start watching a T.V. show, or listening to music, or just scrolling websites like Instagram and Facebook endlessly. 
- This reduces our productivity.
- To avoid this distraction, and to increase productivity while working/studying, I've wriiten a python code that blocks you from visiting these websites during your working hours.
- You can visit these websites when you're not working.

You can change/add the websites that you want to, change your working/studying time according to your need.
